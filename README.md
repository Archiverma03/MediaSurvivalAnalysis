## 🔹 Key Insights (2019–2024)  

📉 **Print Decline**: Copies printed dropped from **44M (2019) → 33M (2024)**, a consistent **5–6% yearly decline**.  

🗑️ **Print Waste**: Jaipur & Varanasi show the largest waste — **3.5–4.5M unsold copies yearly**.

🏙️ **City Revenue Leaders**: **Patna, Bhopal, Jaipur, Mumbai** generate the most ad revenue. Jaipur shows strong circulation-revenue correlation.  

📈 **Revenue Efficiency**: **Lucknow** leads in **ad revenue per circulated copy**, and this efficiency is improving over time.
